Version control is a system that helps track changes to files and documents over time. It allows multiple contributors to work on the same files simultaneously while keeping a record of every modification made to the project. Version control systems are commonly used in software development but can also be beneficial for other types of projects, such as writing documents or collaborating on design files.

The primary purpose of version control is to manage different versions of a project and provide a structured way to track changes, compare modifications, and revert to previous states if needed. It offers the following advantages:

History Tracking: Version control systems maintain a chronological history of changes, providing a detailed record of who made specific modifications and when. This allows for easy identification and tracking of changes over time.

Collaboration: Version control enables multiple developers to work on the same project concurrently. It allows for merging different versions of files, resolving conflicts, and ensuring that everyone has access to the most up-to-date version of the project.

Backup and Recovery: With version control, every change made to a project is stored in a repository, which serves as a secure backup. If a mistake is made or a project needs to be rolled back to a previous state, it can be easily recovered from a specific version in the repository.

Experimentation and Branching: Version control systems allow users to create branches, which are independent lines of development. This enables developers to experiment with new features or make changes without affecting the main project until they are ready to be merged.

Traceability and Auditing: Version control systems provide a complete audit trail, making it possible to track the evolution of a project. This is especially useful for compliance purposes or when analyzing the impact of changes.

Git is one of the most popular distributed version control systems, widely used for its speed, flexibility, and powerful branching capabilities. GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories and offers additional collaboration features such as issue tracking, pull requests, and code review tools
